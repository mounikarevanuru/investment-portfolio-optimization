# Investment Portfolio Optimization
## Introduction
This study presents a comparative analysis of all-stock portfolio construction and optimization by integrating un-supervised clustering with classical mean–variance analysis.The research partitions a universe of 46 publicly traded US companies spanning 11 industry sectors using K-Means and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), employing standardized financial attributes such as size and growth, profitability, liquidity, and market valuation.To determine the optimal portfolio breadth, cardinality constraints within the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) framework are enforced across various candidate portfolio sizes (e.g., 10, 20), and the optimal number of holdings is identified based on the point at which additional assets yield diminishing improvements in Sharpe ratio. For the selected cardinality, representative stocks (medoids or top performers) from each cluster form two preliminary portfolios, subsequently optimized using mean–variance analysis to derive efficient allocations. Finally, the resulting K-Means–MPT and SOM–MPT portfolios are evaluated and
compared based on risk-adjusted returns, providing empirical insights into the relative effectiveness of each clustering approach.The findings contribute to the growing body of literature on data-driven portfolio optimization, highlighting the potential benefits of integrating machine learning–driven clustering techniques into traditional financial decision-making processes.
